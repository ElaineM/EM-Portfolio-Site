		<h2>Questions, Answers and Analysis</h2>
		<h3>I interviewed office managers to better understand the technology problems they faced in their workplace.</h3>
		<div class="section-contain flex-container cf outline">
				<h3>What are some of your biggest challenges at work?</h3>
				<h4>&quot;Sometimes, IT stuff totally overwhelms my workday.&quot;</h4><br>
				<h3>What do you do when someone asks for help with their computer?</h3>
				<h4>&quot;Our technology is kind of dated and I&lsquo;m already juggling so many things. It&lsquo;s exhausting being the &quot;go-to &quot; IT person in my office. The requests for help are just constant.&quot;</h4><br>
				<h3>How much do you know about IT?</h3>
				<h4>&quot;I like technology, but using a spreadsheet to keep track of our computers, software, cloud services, server, and phone system is not efficient. at all.&quot;</h4>
